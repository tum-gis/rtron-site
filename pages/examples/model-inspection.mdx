# Inspection of Models

In order to visualize and investigate the converted OpenDRIVE files, the [FME Data Inspector](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_QuickTranslator/DataInspector/AboutTheDataInspector/FMEDataInspector_about.htm) or the free [FKZViewer](https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/1648.php) can be useful.

The FME Inspector also supports read-in and visualization of point clouds combined with the CityGML dataset.

Moreover, the transformed OpenDRIVE datasets can be compared with models from other data sources, such as [LoD2 building models](https://geodaten.bayern.de/opengeodata/OpenDataDetail.html?pn=lod2) in this example.

Also, the models can be further enhanced by combining them with [LoD3 road space models](https://github.com/savenow/lod3-road-space-models).
