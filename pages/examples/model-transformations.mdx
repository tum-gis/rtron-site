# Model Transformations

Create model derivatives using [FME workbenches](https://www.safe.com/fme/):

![FME Workbench](/media/demos/model-transformations-fme-workbench.png)

This workbench reads a transformed OpenDRIVE dataset and creates:
* a GeoJSON file in a reprojected coordinate system
* a FBX file in a local coordinate system
* and a DWG file for AutoCAD containing only the center lines of the lanes

FME supports a [magnitude of formats](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_ReadersWriters/Format-List-All.htm), including glTF, OBJ, and Unreal Datasmith.
Moreover, FME provides a [variety of transformers](https://www.safe.com/transformers/) that can be combined to realize feature manipulation tasks.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

    R:tr√•n automatically outputs a CityGML v3.0 dataset; for CityGML v2.0, just add `--convert-to-citygml2` as CLI argument.
