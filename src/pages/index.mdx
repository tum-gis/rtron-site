      Processing Library for Road Space Models

</div>

R:trån is an extensible toolkit for processing road space models.
It currently supports the validation of [ASAM OpenDRIVE](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/) road networks and the conversion to semantic 3D city models in [OGC CityGML](https://www.ogc.org/standards/citygml).

## Overview

Download the prebuilt JAR executable from the [releases section](https://github.com/tum-gis/rtron/releases/latest) and make sure that you have at least a JVM 11.
Run r:trån to ...

```bash
# … validate OpenDRIVE datasets
java -jar rtron-*.jar validate-opendrive ./input-opendrive ./output-reports

# … transform OpenDRIVE datasets to CityGML
java -jar rtron-*.jar opendrive-to-citygml ./input-opendrive ./output-citygml
```

R:trån recursively iterates over your OpenDRIVE input datasets and creates the same directory structure for the output folder.

## Features

- Reading and writing of [ASAM OpenDRIVE](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/) files
- OpenDRIVE validation: schema compliance and specification rules
- Conversion of OpenDRIVE road networks to [OGC CityGML](https://www.ogc.org/standards/citygml) version 2.0 and 3.0
