# OpenDRIVE-CityGML Duality

The conceptual data models of OpenDRIVE and CityGML meet requirements from different application domains—automotive and 3D GIS [[1](https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-IV-4-W8-99-2019)].
However, challenges in one domain have already been addressed in the other.
Thus, the concept of the OpenDRIVE-CityGML Duality is being proposed:
With a consistent road space model in both OpenDRIVE and CityGML, the tools from both domains can be applied [[2](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12093799)].

With transformation tools like [FME](/demos/model-transformations), application-specific target formats can be derived from CityGML datasets.
The dual representation enables the usage of generic attributes and Application Domain Extensions (ADEs) of CityGML [[3](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40965-018-0055-6)].
